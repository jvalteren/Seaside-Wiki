Unfortunately, with the growth of the Seaside community, we no longer have public write access to our repositories. We still want to make it as easy as possible for people to contribute, however.

We have fairly detailed [coding conventions](Coding-Conventions) to help maintain portability, so we ask new contributors, initially, to post their code to the Developer Mailing List or to attach it to an issue in the issue tracker. Note: all Seaside code is licensed under the MIT License and, by submitting code to the project, you are agreeing to provide your code under this license. Before submitting, please also ensure that you have the legal rights to license the code you are submitting; in many areas, your employer may own the rights to code you create even in your spare time.

By far, the preferred way to submit code is using an .mcz file for each modified package but you can also provide a fileout/changeset if necessary. Please take the time to add comments and tests and provide a description of the change and the reason for the change in the commit message. Once you have submitted your code, an existing developer will then review the submission and either provide feedback or integrate the change. Sometimes we decide not to integrate a change. When this happens, there is usually a good reason; please ask if you arenâ€™t clear why your submission was not integrated.

Once you have submitted a few patches and are comfortable with our process and coding conventions feel free to ask to be added as a developer on Smalltalkhub Seaside team. Just create an account and ask on the Developer Mailing list, providing your username.

Picking something to work on

If you have no itch to scratch you can pick an issue from the bug tracker that nobody has yet started on to work.

You can see if there are any bugs marked "BiteSize". These issues have been marked by the core developers as being appropriate for someone with limited experience or available time and are a good place to get your feet wet. The issue should have a clearly-documented solution and should normally be doable with a few hours of work or less. Still, they may be harder than we thought so if you run into trouble, feel free to ask for help or clarification on the Developer Mailing List
