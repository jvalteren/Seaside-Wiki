Unlike some low level frameworks Seaside offers built in protection against many common web application vulnerabilities.

# Attacks #

This is how Seaside protects you against common attacks against your web application.

## Session Fixation ##
Further information:

Not possible because client supplied session ids are ignored when no matching session is found. Review the implementors of `#noHandlerFoundForKey:in:context:`.

## Cross-site Scripting (XSS) ##
The Seaside templating engine—the render canvas—escapes all output by default. It therefore adopts a safe by default policy. Special effort has to be taken to render values without escaping. Such places can easily be found and audited by looking at all the senders of #html:.

## Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) ##

Seaside uses a [capability based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability-based_security) security model where only handles to actions are handed to the client. These handles are random numbers that are bound to the session. The same action gets a new random number every time.

## Response Splitting ##
HTTP response splitting is an attack that allows an attacker to control response headers and the body by injecting a header with a CR or LF value. Seaside does not allow CR or LF values in headers which are also not allowed by HTTP.

## Malicious File Execution ##

# Features #
In addition to the protections against the attacks above Seaside offers the following security related features.

## Capabilities ##

## Strict Transport Security (STS) ##

## DoS ##
  * hash collisions
  * request headers (body size)

## Arbitrary Code Execution ##
`Boolean readFrom:`
