# Introduction #

That's a list of what I consider the biggest and hardest to fix regression issues issues Seaside 3.0 has over 2.8


# Details #

  * [#553](https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside/issues/553)): #isolate: broken
  * ~~[#636](https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside/issues/636)): expected exception behavior WAWalkbackErrorHandler not portable (and not ANSI compliant)~~
  * ~~[#727](https://github.com/SeasideSt/Seaside/issues/727)): 	walkback only works for exceptions in callback phase~~
